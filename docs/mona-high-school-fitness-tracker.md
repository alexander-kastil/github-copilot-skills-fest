# Getting started - app frontend and backend creation

## Explain to GitHub Copilot the Goals and Steps

I want to build an OctoFit Tracker app that will include the following:

- User authentication and profiles
- Activity logging and tracking
- Team creation and management
- Competitive leader board
- Personalized workout suggestions

## Task: General Coding Instructions & Tools

### Coding Instructions

Add code generation instructions by creating .vscode/settings.json in the root of the project with the following content:

```
{
    "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
        {
            "file": ".copilot.instructions.md"
        }
    ],
    "github.copilot.chat.setupTests.enabled": true,
    "github.copilot.chat.startDebugging.enabled": true,
    "chat.commandCenter.enabled": true
}
```

Copy `docs/assets/.copilot.instructions.md` to the root of the project.

### Add reusable prompts

Copy `docs/assets/prompts/*.prompt.md` to `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`

### Register the Playwright MCP Server

Copy `docs/assets/mcp.json` to .vscode/mcp.json

## Technical Stack

Generate instructions in this order

1. Frontend and Backend Setup

   - Create a `src` directory for both projects
   - Create `src/octofit-api` for the .NET backend
   - Create `src/octofit-ui` for the Angular frontend

2. Backend Setup (.NET)

   - Use .NET 9 WebAPI template
   - Configure Swagger UI at root endpoint
   - Add Entity Framework Core with SQLite
   - Configure ports: HTTPS (5001), HTTP (5000)
   - Enable CORS for all origins

3. Frontend Setup (Angular)
   - Use Angular CLI 19.2 with Node 20.12.2
   - Include routing
   - Disable SSR
   - Use SCSS styling
   - Add environment configuration with API URL
   - Install and configure Bootstrap
   - Clean up default app component

Let's think about this step by step and generate the code in small steps.

## Task: Implement the Web Api

### SQLite Database, Entity Framework Core and Database Context

- This app is using a SQLite database using Entity Framework Core with a `OctoFitDbContext` class that will be registered in `Program.cs`.

The data models for the OctoFit Tracker consist of the following entities. The app does not use DTO's and the models are used directly in the API. The models are defined in the `Models` folder of the API project. The models are:

1. **User Model**

   - Unique identifier (GUID)
   - Username (required, max 100 characters)
   - Email address (required, valid email format)
   - Password (required, max 100 characters)

2. **Team Model**

   - Unique identifier (GUID)
   - Team name (required, max 100 characters)
   - Collection of team members (Users)

3. **Activity Model**

   - Unique identifier (GUID)
   - User reference (required, foreign key)
   - Activity type (required, max 100 characters)
   - Duration (required, TimeSpan)

4. **Leaderboard Model**

   - Unique identifier (GUID)
   - User reference (required, foreign key)
   - Score (required, integer)

5. **Workout Model**
   - Unique identifier (GUID)
   - Workout name (required, max 100 characters)
   - Workout description (optional)

- When creating the `OctoFitDbContext`, and additional Table 'Flags' is created. The table is used to store the flags for the application like a flag that will be used to ensure that the database is seeded only once with the initial data which will be provided in `docs/assets/seeding_data.json`
