# Build applications with GitHub Copilot agent mode

## Session Abstract

Build applications with GitHub Copilot agent mode. GitHub has significantly enhanced its Copilot offering with the preview release of agent mode. This feature aim to streamline and automate code editing workflows, allowing developers to iterate on code changes more efficiently using natural language prompts. agent mode takes GitHub Copilot even further by enabling Copilot to autonomously plan and execute tasks, including suggesting and running terminal commands, and iterating to resolve issues. These advancements signify a move towards a more "agentic AI" that proactively assists developers throughout the development lifecycle.
