# Implement the Leaderboard List

1. In the octofit-ui/src/app/leaderboard folder, create a LeaderboardComponent. This component will be used to display the leaderboard data in a striped table format.

2. Enable the Leaderboard in the app.routes.ts file. Add a route for the LeaderboardComponent and in the NavBar.

3. Make sure the Angular HttpClient is provided in the app.config.ts using provideHttpClient()

4. Before starting the implementation, share your plan. Keep the order of the tasks. Do not implement anything that you are not asked for. Don't proceed with the next activity until all of these steps are completed.
