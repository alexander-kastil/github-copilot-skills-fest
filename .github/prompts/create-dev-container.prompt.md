# Create a devcontainer.json for Angular and .NET 9

To finalize the initial setup create a devcontainer.json that is capable of running:

1. Angular 19 with min node 20.12.2 and the .NET 9 SDK.

2. Look at my installed extensions and add the Angular and .NET related extensions to the devcontainer including
   `mdickin.markdown-shortcuts`

3. Add the GitHub CLI

4. Make sure the post-create script to ensure appropriate permissions are set during container startup

5. Before starting the implementation, share your plan. Keep the order of the tasks. Don't proceed with the next activity until all of these steps are completed.
